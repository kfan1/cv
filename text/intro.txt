Born in Pullman, Washington and raised in the suburbs of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, I grew up loving the Eagles, building computers, playing video games, running around, and really not much else. Avid sports fan, amateur programmer, and enjoys all things math, science, and technology. Currently residing in Philly with my black cat, Toothless and my girlfriend, Stephanie, and still doing the same things 20 years later. Follow me while I learn to be a better programmer. Take a look at the projects I'm currently working on or on my GitHub.
